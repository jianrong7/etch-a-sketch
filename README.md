# Etch a Sketch Game

## This is a project for The Odin Project.

Heavily inspired by [Frankie](https://frankie-njie.github.io/Etch-a-sketch/)

[Sketching fun](https://jianrong7.github.io/etch-a-sketch/) using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## What I learnt
- Learnt to crid a grid using javascript
- Had a abetter understanding about code design and aesthetics of a website
- Better understanding of Event Listeners in JS
- Refactoring code will help you in the future and anyone trying to read your code


## What I need to work on
- Still not familiar with the concept of creating elements from javascript
- May try again in the future using Flexbox
